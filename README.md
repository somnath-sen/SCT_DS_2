This project Perform data cleaning and Exploratory data analysis on a dataset using Power BI. SCT_DS_2: Skillcraft Technology Internship : Welcome to the repository for my internship tasks at Skillcraft Technology, where I'm working as a Data Science Intern. This repository contains projects focused on building practical skills in data analysis and data visualization tools, such as Microsoft Excel and Power BI. About the Project: The project focuses on analyzing the sales performance of XYZ Company for the financial year 2013-14. The goal is to evaluate the company's profitability across various dimensions, including: Countries, Segments, Market, Product, categories

By leveraging Power BI's capabilities, I designed dynamic report, connected to diverse data sources, and performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover relationships between variables such as sales,product,price etc.

Task 2: Data Cleaning and EDA in Power BI This task involved: Cleaning the dataset for accurate analysis. Performing EDA to identify patterns, trends, and relationships between variables. Visualizations in Power BI: To effectively analyze and represent data, I created the following visuals: Pie Charts, Column Charts, Donut Charts ,Bar Charts ,Line Charts ,Card Visuals, Slicers

These visuals were used to examine the relationship between total sales and various factors such as price, country, region, and market.

This task serves as a foundational exercise in leveraging Power BI for data analysis. Feel free to explore the repository, and connect with me on LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/somnathsen003 if you have any questions or feedback.
